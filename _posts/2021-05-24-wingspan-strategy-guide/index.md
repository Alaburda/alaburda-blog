Wingspan is a bird game. It's great!


# Types of birds

## The god tier

## The food providers

## Caching Food

This includes the woodpeckers. The cards provide points situationally, making them inferior to egg laying birds. However, it's not uncommon to run out of space for eggs, so these birds provide an alternative method.

## Egg-laying

This includes doves and quail. Prioritise these birds! They might seem weak because of the points values but they are definitely worth it over the whole course of the game.

## Card drawing

These birds can be split into a few categories. The cheap "all players draw" birds are great but the expensive ones aren't. The "you draw a card" birds are only great if they are cheap. The early game is difficult because of food scarcity and spending more than 2 resources on a bird will set you back.

## Flocking

I love these birds. They are usually cheap and they always provide a point when triggered. Furthermore, they give you the ability to cycle your hand. Cycling is important in Wingspan because most birds are situational and you want to go through as much of the deck as possible to get the right bird at the right time. That means you want to draw cheap birds at the start of the game and expensive birds at the end of the game.

## Hunters/Fishers

## Bonus drawers

## Play a second bird

Just like the "vanilla" birds, I found these to be great for late game plays when you have a surplus of food.

# Hot tips

## Your focus should be the grasslands

At first, it may seem like the game offers four potential strategies: focusing on one of three biomes (the forest, grassland or wetland), or trying to diversify across all of them. However, the board is misleading. Unlike cards or food tokens, eggs provide points at the end of the game. Because of this, the "lay egg" action is the only action that can consistently provide points. The optimal strategy is to build your tableau so that you could repeatedly lay eggs during the last around and activate as many brown powers as possible.

What's worse, there are almost no forest birds that could turn food tokens into points efficiently. In the wetland, there are birds that allow you to tuck card to lay an egg - those cards are excellent! In fact, it's usually easier to have the wetlands as a supporting biome that provides birds as well as a few points. Alternatively, if you do not have birds that provide food tokens, the forest biome should be your secondary biome instead. Essentially, the grasslands is your focus and one of the other biomes should support the grasslands.

Finally, a potential strategy is to focus on high value birds and building as many of them as possible. At the end of the game, it's frequently worth building one or two high scoring birds. However, a "build ALL the birds" strategy is inferior. To build your 4th bird, you will need to use 2 eggs. That effectively reduces the value of your played bird by 2 points. I believe that is only viable if you are playing either birds without effects (which give 7-9 points) or birds that draw additional bonus cards. Otherwise, laying is just better because usually you can lay 3-4 eggs and trigger a brown effect for an additional point. In the later stages of the game, playing anything worth less than 5 points is a lot of the time going to be worse than laying eggs. 

## Where to place brown, white, pink etc. powers?

With our "grassland first" strategy, we would be planning on triggering egg laying as much as possible. Because of this, it is best to put as many birds with brown powers as possible into the grasslands. Birds with white, teal or pink powers should be placed in the secondary or even tertiary biome. There is no use to put birds without brown powers in biomes you are planning to trigger frequently.

## Action diversification is not always beneficial

After my first few games of Wingspan, I thought that putting different brown powers into one biome is key. If you can lay eggs, get food and draw cards in one action, that's great, isn't it? Because of this, some of the birds described previously are game-breaking. However, it's better to put birds that give points into the grassland, birds with card draw into the wetland and birds with food token abilities into the forest. That way you can spend one action to get all the food or cards you need. Furthermore, this makes sure that laying eggs gives the most amount of points - remember, food tokens and cards are useless at the end of the game!
