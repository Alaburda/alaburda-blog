abstract: Although the pig is a model for heart disease, the neuroanatomy of cardiac ventricles (CV) in this species remains undetailed. We aimed to define the innervation pattern of pig CV, combining histochemistry for acetylcholinesterase, immunofluorescent labeling and electron microscopy. Forty nine examined pig hearts show that the major nerves supplying the ventral side of CV descend from the venous part of the heart hilum. Fewer in number and smaller in size, epicardial nerves supply the dorsal half of the CV. Epicardial nerves on the left ventricle are thicker than those on the right. Ventricular ganglia of various sizes distribute at the basal level of both CV. Averagely, we found 3,848 ventricular neuronal somata per heart. The majority of somata were cholinergic, although ganglionic cells of different neurochemical phenotypes (positive for nNOS, ChAT/nNOS, or ChAT/TH) were also observed. Large and most numerous nerves proceeded within the epicardium. Most of endocardium and myocardium contained a network of nerve bundles and nerve fibers (NFs). But, a large number of thin nerves extended along the bundle of His and its branches. The majority of NFs were adrenergic, while cholinergic NFs were scarce yet more abundant than nitrergic ones. Sensory NFs positive for CGRP were the second most abundant phenotype after adrenergic NFs in all layers of the ventricular wall. Electron microscopy elucidated that ultrastructure of nerves varied between different areas of CV. The described structural organization of CV provides an anatomical basis for further functional and pathophysiological studies in the pig heart.
