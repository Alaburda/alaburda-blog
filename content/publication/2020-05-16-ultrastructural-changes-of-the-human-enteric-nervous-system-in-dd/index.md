title: Ultrastructural changes of the human enteric nervous system and interstitial
  cells of Cajal in diverticular disease
abstract: In spite of numerous advances in understanding diverticular disease, its pathogenesis remains one of the main problems to be solved. We aimed to investigate the ultrastructural changes of the enteric nervous system in unaffected individuals, in asymptomatic patients with diverticulosis and in patients with diverticular disease. The present findings suggest that most ultrastructural changes of the enteric nervous system occur in complicated diverticular disease. The changes are compatible with damage to the enteric nervous system and reactive remodeling of enteric ganglia, nerves and interstitial cells of Cajal. Disrupted architecture of enteric plexuses might explain clinical and pathophysiological changes associated with diverticular disease.
