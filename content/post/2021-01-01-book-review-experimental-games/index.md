*Experimental Games: Critique, Play, and Design in the Age of Gamification* starts out with descontructing the concept of gamification and how it has pervaded various fields. You know at least one of them, any fitness app encourages you to take 10000 steps and *Duolingo* has gamified language learning. There's also more straightforward cases, such as *Habitica* to turn your chores into RPG adventures. The phenomenon of gamification isn't really that novel and it actually stems from the 1980s when games for learning geography, reading or writing were created. Hence the premise of the book - we've come a pretty long way with regards to video games and using elements of games for intentional purposes[^1].

[^1]: As a side note, you could track application of games back to the pre-WWI era. A notable episode is when [Germany was doing naval and infantry tabletop simulations to prepare for World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Approaches_Tactical_Unit). Through playing wargames the Germans were able to outmaneuver British submarines as well as figure out that a blitz-type attack would be a better approach as opposed to the French defensive strategy.

Don't let the cover of the book fool you - the book actually delves not into the history of games, per se, but pinpoints the advent of modern games with the development of game theory. Through the lens of game theory, anything can be a game: if you are going grocery shopping, you are playing a game of minimising your basket cost. If you are a scrolling eBay to bid on items, you are playing an auction game. And so on and so forth.
