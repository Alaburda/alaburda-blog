This is an evergreen post that I plan to update frequently. These are based on either what I have experienced personally or have read but wanted to put down somewhere. Hopefully, you find some of this useful.

## Small company vs Big company

Early on in the career I think gaining a lot hard skills is crucial. Your full time job will take the majority of the day - add commute time, eating, parental care and resting, and pretty soon you'll find that there's little time left in the day for personal improvement. This means that early on you want to find career opportunities that would expose you to learning new skills.

This does not drive your career choices per se. Early on any new job will require you to learn fast anyway. Your learning style matters though. If you are the type of person who learns by example, wants to follow best practices, it might be better to join a mature data analytics team with clearly defined roles. But if you are someone who likes tinkering and trying new things for themselves, a smaller developing team might be better. Team buy in is different whether you're in a big company or a small one - if you really think the team benefits from using R, it's much easier to have a say in it when the company is still figuring out its best practices.

## Soft skills

When it comes to soft professional skills, I think it's much more important to have a good mentor. Poor mentorship can decrease employee motivation and hamper progress while the opposite is true for good mentorship.
