When I have found out BoardGameArena has a Reviewer group with access to unreleased games, I wanted in. One of those games is Xavier Georges' [Carnegie](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/310873/carnegie), an economic game of being the most booming capitalist and benefactor in the 19th century. Can you manage your employees, expand your company, invest in research and build your corporate empire?

In a sense, Carnegie is an economic game with a 4X engine. During a turn, you have four actions: moving employees around your company, sending them on missions around the map, researching new projects or better transport rewards for the missions, and constructing new projects on the map. Usually a 4X game would have a lot of detail, but Carnegie abstracts away a lot of those elements. The "missions" here just means freezing a worker until you can take it back and receive the bonus, and there are only four types of projects that give very similar bonuses. This is great - you get to play a sprawling game without the details that would drag the game.

That lets you focus on the best bits. When you use your HR department, you get to mercilessly push your employees around. Oh, you worked in R&D? Sorry, you're doing Construction now! Construction is also great: the more employees in Construction, the more projects you can build in a turn. Carnegie offers ruthless efficiency: each player can maximise their action, it's up to them to figure out how.

Efficiency works along two axes here, since you only get 20 actions and each player chooses an action that *all* the players will choose. Yes, you can setup a super strong action but it's only important to make sure that you get your timing right. The actions have a sort of cycle to them: first you move employees, then send them on missions and finally return them to receive income.

On top of all this, receiving income is incredibly fun! There is no specific action for it, instead you can return employees from an area based on timelines for each action. Each action has 5 slots in front of them: first four will have a donation event and then three events to return workers from an area (West, Midwest, South or East). When you return a worker, you receive bonuses for *all* the project you have built. At first it may not seen like much but it will snowball to a point where you have too many resources!

All this is a puzzle: maximising the power of your actions, getting the timing right to piggyback on your opponent's choices and pivoting your engine from production to victory points.

Usually economic games punish you for poor play but Carnegie offers a point salad to taste. Building a new department, a new project, making donations, connecting major cities give you points. So far I have learned that there multiple ways to win: you can build a ton of departments, you can focus on a single area on the map, you can build hot public infrastructure, you can improve infrastructure that will drip feed you. The game is not punishing, there are no penalties, it's all about how well you can execute your endeavour.

The few knitpicks that I have is that some end game donations are better than others and the timelines sometimes nudge players to focus on specific areas. Some areas are naturally better for points so some of the games can turn into knife fights for points. Finally, I wouldn't be surprised that analysis paralysis prone players will have a hard time playing this: there are a lot of moving pieces in the game. Theoretically, it is possible to optimise *ALL THE THINGS* but it's better to play through a means-to-an-end lens.

Carnegie provides a thematic avenue to build an engine and build an empire. There is just enough interaction and complexity to make this a meaty game while keeping the downtime low through simultaneous action choice. The mechanics are fun, Ian O'Toole's art is beautiful as well as functional. There's much to love in this game and I can't wait for the Kickstarter.
