When I have found out BoardGameArena has a Reviewer group with access to unreleased games, I wanted in. One of those games is Xavier Georges' [Carnegie](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/310873/carnegie), an economic game of being the most booming capitalist and benefactor in the 19th century. Can you manage your employees, expand your company, invest in research and build your corporate empire?

In a sense, *Carnegie* is an economic game with a 4X engine. You start off humbly with your headquarters and your brazen handful of employees. During a turn, you have four actions: moving employees around your company, sending them on missions around the US, researching new projects or transportation, and constructing new projects around the country. Usually a 4X game would have a lot of detail, but *Carnegie* abstracts away a lot of those elements. The “missions” here just means freezing a worker until you can take it back and receive the bonus, resources are either cubes or money and employees don't have upkeep costs. This abstraction lowers the cursed barrier from the Kallax shelf to the table and makes the game quicker.

The actions themselves are thematic and fun to perform. When you use your HR department, you get to mercilessly push your employees around. Oh, you worked in R&D? Sorry, you’re doing Construction now! Building new departments is fun: you can either build something useful or plop down a department on the 4th floor for points and claim how you care about, say, Research & Development. Construction is also great: the more employees in Construction, the more projects you can build in a turn. Carnegie offers ruthless efficiency: each player can maximise their action, it’s up to them to figure out how. 

Efficiency works along two axes here, since you only get 20 actions and each player chooses an action that all the players will execute. Yes, you can setup a super strong action but it’s only important to make sure that you get your timing right and have something to do on the next turn. The actions have a sort of cycle to them: first you move employees, then send them on missions and finally return them to receive income. Ignoring the cycle won't punish you but won't reward you either.

To reinforce timing, actions also trigger income collection. There is no specific action for income, instead the event allows players to return their workers back to their HQ. When you return a worker, you receive bonuses for all the project you have built. At first it may not seen like much but as you build more projects you receive more resources. This positive feedback loop leads to a puzzle: maximising the power of your actions, getting the timing right to piggyback on your opponent’s choices and pivoting your engine from production to victory points. In a sense, this reminds me of *Concordia* where there's indirect interaction but you have to react to your opponents.

Usually economic games punish you for poor play but Carnegie offers a point salad to taste. Building a new department, a new project, making donations, connecting major cities give you points. So far I have learned that there are multiple ways to win: you can build a ton of departments, you can focus on a single area on the map, you can build hot public infrastructure, you can improve infrastructure that will drip feed you. The game is not punishing, there are no penalties, it’s all about how well you can execute your endeavour. Of course, it goes without saying less experienced players will certainly lose the first few games.

The few knitpicks that I have is that some end game donations are better than others and the timelines sometimes nudge players to focus on specific areas. Some areas are naturally better for points so some of the games can turn into knife fights for points. Finally, I wouldn’t be surprised that analysis paralysis prone players will have a hard time playing this: there are a lot of moving pieces in the game. Theoretically, it is possible to optimise **ALL THE THINGS** but it’s better to play through a means-to-an-end lens.

Carnegie provides a thematic avenue to build an engine and build an empire. There is just enough interaction and complexity to make this a meaty game while keeping the downtime low through simultaneous action choice. The mechanics are fun, Ian O’Toole’s art is beautiful as well as functional. There’s much to love in this game and I recommend you take a look at the kickstarter.
