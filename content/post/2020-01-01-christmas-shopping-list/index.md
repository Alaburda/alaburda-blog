After Christmas season in 2019, I decided to think through the presents I gifted and create a list of gift ideas that I could refer back to in the future. I believe this could be useful to someone as well so that's why I am putting it here instead of a doc. Of course, only you know your gift recipient best - the following is just a list of ideas as opposed to a guide or a 5-minute solution to your Christmas shopping troubles. With that out of the way, enjoy! 

## Books etc

1. [And Other Stories](https://www.andotherstories.org/subscriptions/) - an independent book publisher with a subscription service. The idea is that you subscribe to receive a number of their books with each containing a list of subscribers, including yours or the giftee's! From what I had read, their fiction selection is good and shouldn't disappoint. Price ranges depending on the subscription plan. 
2. [New Eastern Europe](https://neweasterneurope.eu/subscribe/) - a political magazine focused on Eastern Europe. The quality of their articles has been good and the magazine itself is a beautiful A5-sized volume, making it an impressive gift.
3. [Phaidon](https://uk.phaidon.com/store/) - their selection is mixed but some of their books can be the perfect gift for the right person. For example, if you know a doctor or a medical student, their [Anatomy book](https://uk.phaidon.com/store/general-non-fiction/anatomy-exploring-the-human-body-9780714879888/) would be pretty much the perfect gift.
4. [Taschen](https://www.taschen.com/) - Taschen may seem more pretentious than Phaidon judging from their price range, but they do have good gifts as well! I would go for the small A5-sized volumes, such as the one on [Soviet archtecture](https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/architecture/all/49365/facts.frederic_chaubin_cccp.htm) or a book on [natural history](https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/classics/all/05420/facts.seba_cabinet_of_natural_curiosities.htm).
5. Other beautiful books - if Taschen or Phaidon are all about signalling to you, I feel you. Other notable books are [Spineless](https://www.amazon.com/Spineless-Portraits-Marine-Invertebrates-Backbone/dp/1419710079/), [Seeking Leviathan](https://cswannphotography.com/book/) and [Stripe Press](https://press.stripe.com/) produces beautiful books. Lastly, I might as well suggest Emily Wilson's translation of [The Odyssey](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Odyssey-Homer/dp/0393356256).
5. [Fantagraphics](https://www.fantagraphics.com/) - eye-watering shipping to the EU, but the selection is excellent and the Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals are fairly good.
6. Cookbooks - cookbooks have become much better in the last decade, going from a list of recipes to an illustrated guide of recipes as well as the history of the cuisine. There is more than I can list here, but it is a good idea to check out the [James Beard awards](https://www.jamesbeard.org/blog/this-years-best-cookbooks). I would probably recommend [the Food of Sichuan](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Food-Sichuan-Fuchsia-Dunlop/dp/1408867559), the much lauded [Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat-Mastering/dp/1782112308/), [The Last Course](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/037550429X/) or [Sababa](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0525533451/).
7. Graphic novels - yes, this is more niche than other choices but graphic novels don't have as large a burden as regular books and make for great table books. Examples include Watchmen, My Favourite Thing is Monsters, anything by Guy Delisle and Chris Ware's magnificent creations.

## Board games

1. Light games: [Codenames](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames) and [Similo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/268620/similo). I have played Codenames with probably 30-40 different people and the game has always proven to be interesting. Also, Codenames usually has a localised version so be sure to get that! And avoid the Pictures variant, it does not hold a candle to the original. Similo is a new game and so far it edges out the classic Dixit by being shorter and cheaper.
2. Gamer's games: [Wingspan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266192/wingspan) and [Azul](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230802/azul). Wingspan is a treat on a table with one of the best themes in the industry, while Azul stays on the lighter side while delivering a more competitive puzzle. 
3. Children's games: [Rhino Hero](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/91514/rhino-hero) is a travel-friendly version of Jenga that adults can enjoy (I did!), and [Ice Cool](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/177524/icecool) seems to be a great dexterity game.
4. Board game upgrades! There's basically three things you can upgrade: add board game expansions, add sleeves or upgrade the components. Some publishers offer metal coins (e.g. [Scythe](https://stonemaier-games.myshopify.com/products/metal-coins-scythe-asia?variant=25456101190), [7 Wonders](https://shop.rprod.com/en/7-wonders-duel/52-7-wonders-duel-metal-coins.html)) or luxury components ([Scythe](https://stonemaier-games.myshopify.com/products/scythe-metal-mechs-1-from-each-faction), [Azul](https://www.nextmovegames.com/en/home/31-azul-joker-tiles.html)). Other places to check out are Etsy, the [BGG Store](https://boardgamegeekstore.com/) and [Spiele Material](https://www.spielematerial.de/en/) You can also make your own! For example, if your friend has Terraforming Mars, you could make 3D printed tiles, but be sure to head to BoardGameGeek for lots more ideas! 
5. Accessories: [Silicone Storage Bowls](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Collapsible-Portable-Accessory-Components-Roleplaying/dp/B08DCDRVJQ), [First Player Pickers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ddfly-Shocking-Roulette-Detector-Reloaded/dp/B07G9H2QG8/)
6. Board game books:
  * The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Jesse Schell
  * Gamish: A Graphic History of Gaming, Edward Ross
  * How to Host A Game Night, Erik Arneson
  * Dice Games Properly Explained, Reiner Knizia
  * Tabletop Gaming Manual, Matt Thrower
  * Playing at the World, Jon Peterson
  * Gametek: The Math and Science of Gaming, Geoff Engelstein
  * Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design: An Encyclopedia of Mechanisms, Geoffrey Engelstein and Isaac Shalev
  * Finite and Infinite Games, James P. Carse
  * Homo Ludens, Johan Huizinga
  * Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals, Katie Salen Tekinbas and Eric Zimmerman

## Consumables

1. Chocolate - David Siegel has a wonderful [guide](https://medium.com/@pullnews/david-siegels-chocolate-porn-156f648a69ab). I will be sure to try it out next year! Amedei has their e-shop in Italy with wonderful discounts during Black Friday.
2. Coffee and tea - for tea, I would probably check out [eteaket](https://www.eteaket.co.uk/). For coffee, I would either go for a local roaster (in my case, it's Huracan Coffee) but there is wonderful list on [Reddit here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/9272cl/where_to_buy_roasted_coffee_beans_in_europe/).
3. Socks - I know, they are not consumables but they do wear out and get lost! Exactly the reason why gifting socks is a good idea - eventually your friend is going to run out and will need a pair. There's [Darn Tough](https://darntough.com/collections/men) for hikers, [Gammarelli](https://www.meschaussettesrouges.com/en/3_gammarelli) or [Marcoliani](https://www.marcoliani.it/en/distribution/) to show what a classy friend you are, [Stance](https://euro.stance.eu.com/) for the mid tier pricing, and [Anonymous Ism](https://anonymousism.com/) if you think your friend will like linen Japanese socks.

## Kitchenware

1. Literally anything from [Iittala](https://www.iittala.com/collections/iittala/tools/c/tools/intro) - this is an _expensive_ option but we are talking about items that will last for a long time.
2. High end knives - [Mr. Siegel](https://medium.com/@pullnews/david-siegels-knife-porn-ea19f8553e79?) and [ChefSteps](https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/the-chefsteps-kitchen-team-shares-their-favorite-knives) have great guides. Again, this is a costly gift but one that will last a lifetime.
3. Food thermometers - underrated.
4. Wine bottle caps - I brought back a pair for myself but apparently my family wanted some for themselves after having seen them!
5. Mandoline - yes, there are cheap ones out there but what you really want is a mandoline from [Benriner](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=mandoline+benriner&ref=nb_sb_noss).
6. [Articture](https://articture.com/) for other ideas. 

## Home decor

1. Georg Jansen Christmas ornaments - [these](https://www.georgjensen.com/global/christmas/scandinavian-christmas-decorations) are especially effective if you are exchanging gifts before Christmas but I would recommend them nonetheless. They are darn beautiful on a tree!
2. [Nordic Nest](https://www.nordicnest.com/) for other ideas.

## Electronics and hardware

1. [Tile](https://www.thetileapp.com/en-eu/) - sure, they go on the more expensive side when it comes to gifts but it's great for a friend who keeps misplacing their stuff or is about to move to another city or wants to feel secure.
2. [A mini box cutter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M1XZXGU) - cheap and supposedly cuts better than your standard box cutter.
3. Large mousepads - who needs a scratch off world map when you can have a [mouse pad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IR37TXM/).
4. [Smart power outlets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MV7F26P/ref=psdc_6291368011_t1_B07BGT5RX6) - depends on the region, linking type C for Europe.
5. [Smart power outlet with remote](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DQELHBS/)
6. [Power monitor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CVMAK2M/) - you know how charging a phone via a laptop's USB port is horribly slow? This fixes that.
7. [External power banks](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mophie-PowerStation-X-Large-Portable-Charger-Black/dp/B07K4YQDLC/) - my suggestion would be Mophie but my huntch is that you would probably want to avoid the cheapest options altogether.
8. [Logitech Spotlight Remote](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/spotlight-presentation-remote) - if I were still teaching, I sure as heck would want one!

## Handmade ideas

1. [Cash in fake toy boxes](https://twitter.com/TwoClawsMedia/status/1210030954485633025)
2. [Recipes in a jar](https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/recipes-for-gifts-in-a-jar/) - the idea being that you have already measured the ingredients, all your friend has to do is add water/eggs/milk.
